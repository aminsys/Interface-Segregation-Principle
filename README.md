# Interface-Segregation-Principle
A repo to illustrate an example project implemented by following the Interface Segregation Principle.

This principle states that interfaces should be specific and the developer shouldn't be forced to implement and use functionality that they don't need. This principle sounds similar to the Single Responsibility Principle where a large interface with many method declarations should be divided into many interfaces with method declarations that have specific intends.
